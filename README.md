### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love building applications and working across the stack, and my focus so far has been on web applications and technologies. I'm constantly looking to push myself and explore new opportunities, and I'm currently involved in several open-source communities. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the next-generation backend database infrastructure for [Hack for LA][hfla]
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring how to deploy a docker image on AWS, using ECR, ECS, RDS, Terraform and Terragrunt.
- ðŸ’¬ I'm currently learning... to put myself out there!
